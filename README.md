This R-package contains a Shiny application to explore the WLS data. You
will need to obtain a copy of the data for yourself. For more, see
https://wls.wisc.edu.

For more details about the data, see the [WLS data
portal](https://wls.portal.ssc.wisc.edu).

## Installation

You can install `wlsDataBrowser` using the `remotes` packages as
follows:

``` r
remotes::install_github("rmtrane/wlsDataBrowser")
```

## Run App

You can run the Shiny application interactively using the following:

``` r
wlsDataBrowser::wlsDataBrowser()
```

You can optionally set the file path so you donâ€™t manually have to
choose the file when running the application. Add the following to your
.Rprofile file with the path to your local copy of the data:

``` r
options(wlsDataBrowser.data_path = "/path/to/wls/data.dta")
```

You will need to restart your R session for the changes to take effect.

## RStudio add-in

Once installed, you should be able to find the `wlsDataBrowser` in the
RStudio add-in dropdown menu. You might have to restart RStudio for the
add-in to show up.

## Positron keyboard shortcut

If using [Positron](https://positron.posit.co), the following snippet
can be added to `keybindings.json` to easily launch the data browser
(here, keyboard combo `cmd+alt+shift+w` launches the data browser):

``` json
{
    "key": "cmd+alt+shift+w",
    "command": "workbench.action.executeCode.silently",
    "description": "Browse WLS Data",
    "args": {
        "langId": "r",
        "code": "wlsDataBrowser:::wlsDataBrowser()"
    }
}
```

Search for `Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)` using the command palette
(`cmd/ctrl+shift+p`) to open the `keybindings.json` file.
