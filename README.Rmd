# wlsDataBrowser

This R-package contains a Shiny application to explore the WLS data. You will need to obtain a copy of the data for yourself. For more, see https://wls.wisc.edu. 

For more details about the data, see the [WLS data portal](https://wls.portal.ssc.wisc.edu).

## Installation

You can install the development version of wlsDataBrowser like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("rmtrane/wlsDataBrowser")
```

## Run App

You can run the Shiny application interactively using the following:

``` r
wlsDataBrowser::wlsDataBrowser()
```

You can optionally set the file path so you don't have to choose a file every times. Add the following to your .Rprofile file with the path to your local copy of the data:

``` r
options(wlsDataBrowser.data_path = "/path/to/wls/data.dta")
```

## RStudio add-in

Once installed, you should be able to find the `wlsDataBrowser` in the RStudio add-in dropdown menu. You might have to restart RStudio for the add-in to show up.
